# Mathematics of Deep Learning

[A mathematical theory of deep networks and of why they work as well as they do is now emerging. I will review some recent theoretical results on the approximation power of deep networks including conditions under which they can be exponentially better than shallow learning. A class of deep convolutional networks represent an important special case of these conditions, though weight sharing is not the main reason for their exponential advantage. I will also discuss another puzzle around deep networks: what guarantees that they generalize and they do not overfit despite the number of weights being larger than the number of training data and despite the absence of explicit regularization in the optimization?](http://www.mit.edu/~9.520/fall17/Classes/deep_learning_theory.html)

## Differential Equation and Deep Learning

[We derive upper bounds on the complexity of ReLU neural networks approximating the solution maps of parametric partial differential equations. In particular, without any knowledge of its concrete shape, we use the inherent low-dimensionality of the solution manifold to obtain approximation rates which are significantly superior to those provided by classical approximation results. We use this low dimensionality to guarantee the existence of a reduced basis. Then, for a large variety of parametric partial differential equations, we construct neural networks that yield approximations of the parametric maps not suffering from a curse of dimension and essentially only depending on the size of the reduced basis.](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/i26_fg-kutyniok/Kutyniok/Papers/Parametric_PDEs_and_NNs_.pdf)
