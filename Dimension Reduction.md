### Dimension Reduction

Principal component analysis or singular value decomposition can applied to matrix approximation.
The data collected in practice always save in the table form, which can considered as a matrix. Another techniques similar to PCA is  eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition.

The basic idea of dimension reduction is that not all information are necessary for a specific task.
