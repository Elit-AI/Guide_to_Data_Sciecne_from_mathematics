# Computational Intelligence

Computational intelligence is rooted in the artificial neural network and evolutionary algorithms.
[No free lunch theorem](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/No_free_lunch_in_search_and_optimization) implies  that searching for the ‘best’ general purpose black box optimization algorithm is irresponsible as no such procedure is theoretically possible.

## Swarm Intelligence(SI)

Swarm intelligence is the study of computational systems inspired by the
'collective intelligence'. Collective Intelligence emerges through the cooperation of large numbers of homogeneous agents in the environment.

[Terrence J. Sejnowski](https://cnl.salk.edu/) in *The Deep Learning Revolution* asserts that
>The only existence proof that any of the hard problems in artificial intelligence can be solved is the fact that, through evolution, nature has already solved them.

However, the evolution itself is not clear for us since the [Darwin's Theory Of Evolution](https://www.darwins-theory-of-evolution.com/) was proposed.
[Natural selection](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Natural_selection) is really based on the principles of physics and chemistry, but not all animals live in the world understand physics or chemistry.
From different levels and perspectives, we would research the adaptiveness, intelligence and evolution.
