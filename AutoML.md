# AutoML

AutoML is aimed to find the best algorithm for the specific task.

AutoML draws on many disciplines of machine learning, prominently including

* Bayesian optimization;
* Meta learning
* Transfer learning
* Regression models for structured data and big data
* Combinatorial optimization.

AutoML is regarded as an approach to general artificial intelligence.
Different from the supervised machine learning, AutoML is to tune the hyper-parameters,
which is handed tuned in usual algorithm.
Evolutionary or genetic algorithms are applied to solve some problems.
