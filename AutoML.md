# AutoML

AutoML is aimed to find the best algorithm for the specific task.

AutoML draws on many disciplines of machine learning, prominently including

* Bayesian optimization;
* Meta learning;
* Transfer learning;
* Regression models for structured data and big data;
* Combinatorial optimization.

Bayesian optimization is introduced in Bayesian Learning. Meta learning will extends beyond the stacking generalization.

AutoML is regarded as an approach to general artificial intelligence.
Different from the supervised machine learning, AutoML is to tune the hyper-parameters,
which is handed tuned in usual algorithm.
Evolutionary or genetic algorithms are applied to solve some unstructured problems.
